> :warning: The class `Voilab\Slim\Middleware\ContentTypes` has been moved to a separate package [gammadia/voilab-slim-extensions](https://github.com/gammadia/voilab-slim-extensions) !

This is a **partial split fork** (it contains only the i18n related files) of `voilab/slim-extensions`, adapted for modern PHP development, which supports :

* PHP `7.2` <-> `8.0`

The following changes were applied to the dev dependencies :

* PHPStan baseline added to keep the code in good health
* Add GitHub Actions for continuous integration
